# About Me

I just really like making things.

If you look at my resume, all of my positions have read "Salesforce Developer", but that's not what I call myself.

I'm a maker. A tinkerer. A dabbler. If I'm trying to make myself sound good, I can pass as an "engineer".

I fell into Salesforce by way of a bootcamp, but I was into making things (including software) long before that.

When I was around 10, I wanted to be an author. I think that can still happen.

I started playing music around the same time. I started off on alto sax; by the time I hit high school I had picked up baritone sax, bass, guitar, and bassoon. After high school, I didn't touch music for a long time.

Then I bought myself a piano just before I turned 40.

Making things is beautiful. There's just something special about bringing something into existence.

It took me far too long to realize the importance of loving the craft, regardless of the results.

Results are cruel. Even if they're good, they're never good _enough_.

The craft is where the beauty and passion lies.
